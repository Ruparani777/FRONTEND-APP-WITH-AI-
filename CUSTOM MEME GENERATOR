Let's go over an example. Suppose you want to make a custom meme generator. In that case, you should search for AI models specifically trained to work with images, such as Stability's Stable Diffusion and OpenAI's DALLÂ·E 3.

After that, you can explore the best APIs and SDKs that you can use to take advantage of these AI models and create a basic sample.

To illustrate, let's use the Replicate Node SDK, which provides a convenient method to interact with the Stable Diffusion AI model and set up a basic Node.js program that we can later integrate into our React application.

Step 1. Get your token from https://replicate.com/account
Copy the token ,paste within cat.js code
Step 2: Install the Node SDK with the npm command: npm install replicate
Step 3: Query the Stable Diffusion AI model via the replicate SDK.
